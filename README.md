# TaskTimeTracker

A simple application for tracking hours and minutes on tasks. They are specified by a number and a description.

TODO:
- Integration with the Atlassian Jira API to allow automatic logging of time in Jira based on their task number/ID.
- Remove internal registration of seconds used for easier development.
- Show erros in popup window instead of logging to terminal. Make it work for both Windows and Linux if possible?

BUGS:
- Table is only updated when changing tasks.
